================================================================================================================================

Axolotl AI | Open Source Machine Learning Engineer                                                   January 2025 - Present
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building distributed infrastructure for LLM post-training.

- Added N-dimensional parallelism support in HuggingFace Accelerate, enabling hybrid FSDP + tensor parallelism + context
  parallelism for multi-node training.

- Added support for several post-training paradigms:
  - Quantization-aware training with int4/fp8/nvfp4 layouts
  - Process reward modeling for training reward models for fine-grained feedback
  - Support for local-first, secure training of LLMs with GRPO using interpreter feedback

- Experience in fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs at scale across these paradigms:
  - QAT on models up to 72B across multiple nodes
  - Process reward models and GRPO at single node scale

- Substantial experience in profiling and optimizing performance bottlenecks:
  - Implemented efficient checkpointing and model meta-device initialisation for FSDP2
  - Significant memory efficiency improvements in FSDP2 over Accelerate
  - Improved performance for (Q)LoRA and FSDP2
  - Eliminated NCCL timeouts in PEFT MoE training
  - Added throughput and memory usage monitoring for benchmarking distributed training runs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Deep learning for medical imaging: UNets, Mask-RCNN, Cascade-RCNN. Developed novel UNet architecture for imbalanced
  segmentation, improving detection metrics by 250%.

- Supervised MSc thesis with University of Girona on federated learning for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation, resulting in
  novel algorithm outperforming SOTA.

- Led 3-year research study applying deep learning to clinical data for early detection of coronary heart disease. Primary
  author on resulting paper.
